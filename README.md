# Dungeon-Master-Dev
Dungeon Master Development Version

This version of the Dungeon Master is the development version, it will have the newest features, but it wont necessarily be save game friendly or stable.

TO USE THIS: Download the folder, place it in your CK2 mod folder, and move the .mod from this folder to the root mod folder - to be honest, if you need instructions for this you probably shouldn't be using this.
