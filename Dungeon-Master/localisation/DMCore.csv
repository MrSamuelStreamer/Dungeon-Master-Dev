DMCoreEvtdesc22;"I've been doing some MORE science recently, and I have discovered that actually [religion_proven.GetName] is probably right! I can't guarantee it, but I've just casually slid the important documents under every rulers door. It's up to them what they do with it - I'm not their mother.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt22OptA;"My god... he's right.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt22OptB;"My god, he's gone completely mad...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt22OptC;"This is... interesting...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip22;Some rulers may convert to [religion_proven.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle23;Lost City of Gold Uncovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc23;Rumours have always persisted around [lost_province_of_gold.GetName] speaking of the lost city of gold, but many dismissed it as the dreams of a desperately poor people. The Dungeon Master, feeling a great pity for the people in [lost_city_of_gold.GetName] decided to make all of their dreams come true and transformed the whole city, including it's foundations, and natural resources, into solid gold!\nUnfortunately, the tricky caused by the Dungeon Master had an unintended side effect - people were randomly turning to gold and infecting others with the same curse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt23OptA;"To own such a city... but the risk is too great!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip23B;Random characters have a chance of turning into solid gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip23;The owner of [lost_city_of_gold.GetName] will be tremendously wealthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle24;Balance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc24;The Dungeon Master appears in front of you.\nHe raises his hand and snaps his fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt24OptA;"Wha...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip24;Half of all living people die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle25;A Rose by Any Other Name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc25;"Hello!" shouts the Dungeon Master, scaring courtiers and priests alike, "I've had quite a few names given to me by frightened men, some scarier than others. One of the most memorable was a few years back - the locals used to call me the Angel of... something, but that's not important. The point is it was incredibly rude of them, I mean, all I did was this!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt25OptA;"What did you do...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip25;The oldest child of each ruler dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle26;King of Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc26;"I've lived a very long life and met some interesting fellows - Oh! I know, I'll introduce you to one now!" You turn and try and tell the Dungeon Master to stop, but he had already disappeared in a cloud of... sand?\n\nA great voice echoes around the halls speaking a foreign tongue that slowly begins to fade into your own language:\n\n"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt26OptA;"Batten down the hatches! Quickly!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip26;An ancient king stirs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle27;Ruler of the Jewels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc27;"I'm friends with a great jeweler, he's quite a tame guy by my standards, but he has a real talent when it comes to making rings - pretty generous too! He gave me a whole bunch of rings to hand out to lucky people! I'll see if I have one for you here.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt27OptA;"This doesn't sound suspicious in the least!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip27;Nine for Mortal Men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle28;Cultural Exchange;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc28;"I've decided that [culture1.GetName] and [culture2.GetName] are both very backwards cultures. I've decided that both of you horribly boring people are going to speak each others languages, eat each others disgusting foods, and wear each others stupid shoes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt28OptA;"Well that's not very sensitive, this is a civilised time!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip28;All characters of the two cultures switch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle29;Blessing in Disguise...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc29;"I've been doing a bit of poking around and at the bottom of a lake I found a age-old container filled to the brim with religious texts! I have no idea who put those there but, in my usually helpful nature, I've decided to forward a copy to the relevant religious heads so they can study and make the changes that their religion must have conveniently forgotten about!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt29OptA;"We have to do WHAT now?!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip29;Random religions randomly gain random alterations from a random list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle30;Realm fit for a King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc30;"Maybe I've been looking at it all wrong..." says the Dungeon Master, stroking his beard, "You sick people. You actually ENJOY this don't you? This is all game to you isn't it. Unbelievable. Well, I know exactly what will solve that problem!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt30OptA;"There's... nothing left to do...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip30;Empires are stabilised and vassals become content.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle31;Perfectly Normal Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc31;"What is WRONG with you people!?" screams the Dungeon Master, "Look at this person, this person RIGHT HERE" he says, gesturing to a perfectly normal person standing in your court. You don't recognise them but they certainly look very normal to you. "NOTHING at ALL looks strange about this person here?!" You gesture to your guards to have the Dungeon Master removed, clearly he has lost his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt31OptA;"My apologies my perfectly normal friend, welcome!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip31;A perfectly normal person joins your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle32;Fountain of Youth Uncovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc32;During routine maintenance in the temple of [fountain_of_youth_holding.GetName] in [fountain_of_youth_province.GetName] a great wellspring was discovered unlike any other - through the rockface beneath the foundation flows a seemingly unlimited source of crystal clear, glowing, water. Believing it to be a divine gift, the local ruler of the province bathed in the waters and drank deeply, only to discover that their strength grew rapidly and the ravages of time seemed to be reversed!\nThe local holy man has declared the site as sacred, with only the blessed ruler being allowed entrance into the divine fountain. Though for some jealous rulers perhaps, this may not be enough to prevent their curiosity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt32OptA;"Bountiful health and long life...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip32;The Fountain of Youth is discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip32B;The owner of the province will occasionally gain health and grow younger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle33;Gary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc33;"Let me introduce you to my friend Gary. Gary loves playing my games, don't you Gary?" asks the Dungeon Master as he slaps a timid and shellshocked man on the back, who in turn audibly squeaks. "See Gary has always dreamt big, but he never quite made it, so I'm going to let him live vicariously! Every court throughout the land will get their very own Gary, fruit directly from the loin's of Gary Prime!"\nSuddenly a nefarious looking copy of Gary pops into your court, "Buuuut..." continues the Dungeon Master, "These Gary's will be slightly amped up. Much more ambitious and skilled than the original, so watch your back!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33OptA;"Erm... welcome... Gary?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip33;Gary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle34;Friends in High Places;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc34;"I basically only exist to watch the suffering of others, but you people just do suffering so much more efficiently. There are the occasional occasions where occasionally you do take things a bit too far. Ruin the fun entirely. Here." the Dungeon Master fishes around into his pocket before handing you a small paper card - 'Get out of Jail Free' is written on it, "Just so that the suffering isn't interrupted too much...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt34OptA;"This could come in handy...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip34;All rulers gain a single-use 'Get Out of Jail Free' allowing for instant release from imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle35;Prison Riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc35;"I've been doing some snooping around and noticed there were some people stuck in your basement behind bars, and try as they might they just couldn't find a way out!" You take a sharp breath and brace yourself.\n"So, I happily showed the the way out! You don't have to thank me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt35OptA;"Fetch my guards...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip35;All imprisoned characters are released and become rivals with their jailer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle36;Gavelkindness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc36;The Dungeon Master appears looking pensive "I have no idea what this Gavelkind is but every time I bring it up you land owners always turn a funny colour." You feel your stomach turn at the sound of the forbidden word. "I've decided that a punishment for all those naughty rulers will be this 'Gavelkind' thing... whatever it is.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt36OptA;"No... he wouldn't...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip36;All characters with serious crimes such as §PImpalers§! or §RKinslayers§! will be forced into Gavelkind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle37;Spa Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc37;"I've got plans today, can't do any of the usual evil!" says the Dungeon Master, dashing through your court with a suitcase, "A Hotelier friend of mine gave me these tickets, claimed he was a huge fan of my work, but the hotel is all the way in the north west of Britainia, wherever that is. They're yours if you want them!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt37OptA;"Free Personal Trainer?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt37OptB;"Free Mud Baths?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip37A;You push yourself in a work out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip37B;You cover yourself in mud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle38;Happy Little Accident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc38;"I was visiting a friend of mine and it turns out he had someone there that definitely fit in with his... regular crowd. Anyway he's far too nice to be left down there so I'm putting him under your care. He tells me he's quite talented!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt38OptA;"Welcome Mr... Ross was it?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip38;A talented courtier arrives in your court who will produce happy little accidents while he's around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle39;Everyone's Under 4;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc39;"I just found a brilliant new game to play! It's called EU4. You take control of a kingdom somewhere in the world, and then you 'paint the map' as all my friends would say. Would you like to give it a go?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMEventTooltip39C;All playable rulers are forced to play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle40;Duke Nukem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc40;"I've never understood Dukes, they're just Counts but with vassals, like Kings, or Emperors, but smaller. And don't even get me started on Petty Kings, or Dukes called Kings, or Dukes formally known as Prince? None of this makes any sense! I'm simplifying the entire system - Dukes are now banned. Emperors are next, mark my words.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt40OptA;"Nobody steals our titles... and lives!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip40;All Duke tier titles are destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle41;Stroke of Genius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc41;"It's always the same with you people" begins a very judgemental Dungeon Master, "It's always genius, strong, fair, claims, whatever with you people, never what's on the INSIDE. And that's all that counts. Well, in hindsight, I guess genius is on the inside, now that I think about it... and claims too... Well don't think you're getting away with it that easily!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt41OptA;"You seem... different?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip41;Everyone becomes Genius...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle42;Crab Rave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc42;"Look, your other options are Scorpion rave, Lion rave, or Goat rave. I think your life expectancy is much better with this, trust me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt42OptA;"I was born in September!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip42;Everyone gains Cancer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle43;Meek will Inherit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc43;"You've all had your chance and really blown it. Just absolutely ruined this earth. Temperatures are increasing, the world economy is in absolute shambles, and your kids are never going to be able to afford housing at this rate. And before you start complaining, the alternate name for this event was 'Okay Boomer' so be glad you're not going out with a bang.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt43OptA;"The nanny raised the children, not us!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip43;Rulers over 12 die a horrible death, unless players have no valid heir under 12 at which point a different fate befalls them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle44;Wyvernballs Arrive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc44;Across the known world great lights have been spotted falling from the sky. Though there are many records of rocks descending from the heavens, this time their descent is seen from every corner of the known world. Priests and holy men claim that the rocks are messages from their gods, while treasure hunters and fortune finders gear up for great expeditions to find the fallen stars.\n"I know, I know" begins the Dungeon Master "We agreed no references, but this one I've had ready for a long time and I thought I'd better put it to good use.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt44OptA;"I... I must collect more!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip44;Rulers over 12 die a horrible death, unless players have no valid heir under 12 at which point a different fate befalls them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle45;Marks and Angels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc45;"So I've been reading some of the works of some fine lads called Charles Marks and Fred Angels," the Dungeon Master says, looking up from a little red book. "Their ideas of wealth redistrubution has given me an idea...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt45OptA;"Uh oh.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt45OptB;"NO, MY PRECIOUS MONEY!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt45OptC;"Oh, this benefits me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip45;All playable rulers will have their wealth taken from them and redistributed evenly. As a side note, the Dungeon Master doesn't know what 'redistributed' means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc46;"Do you like chess?" the Dungeon Master asks with a wide, sinister grin on his face. "I do! In fact, I love it so much that I've invited a friend over to play with me. I forgot to bring the chess pieces, but no matter! We'll be using you lot!"\nThe Dungeon Master scratches his chin in thought and smirks. "So, tell me, what colour do you like?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle46;The Chessboard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt46OptA;"I like all colours!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt46OptB;"Uhh... white?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvt46Tooltip;Two random rulers will become the White Queen and the Black Queen, and all other rulers around them will be their tributaries. The tributaries on the losing side will suffer dire consequences for their failure. Knight to King 4.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc47;"I simply adore animals!" exclaims the Dungeon Master while playing around with a kitten, making it chase a peacock feather. "The tiny ones, the big ones, the ones with sharp teeth that will eviscerate you in a moments notice..." He looks up at you and smirks wildly. "Would you like your own pet? Only 50 coins, and it can be yours! And I promise it wont die!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle47;Pet Shop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt47OptA;"Sure, I'll buy one!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt47OptB;"Eh, another time, perhaps.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt47OptC;"But you already sold me one before...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt47TooltipA;A randomly-chosen pet will appear on your character screen as a character modifier. All are permanent and beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt47TooltipB;All rulers will be given the option to buy a pet of their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc48;"I've recently come across seven strange men," the Dungeon Master quips. "They are a quirky bunch, all of them are dwarves, singing while they work in the salt mines. But they do seem lonely. They have expressed their desire to join the court of a delightfully-female ruler. Don't ask me how delightfully-female is different from regular female.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle48;Snow White;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt48OptA;"Seven dwarves? What is this, a fairy tale?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip48;One playable female ruler in the world will receive a gift of seven dwarves of varying usefulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc49;"Family is the most important thing in the world," quips the Dungeon Master while stroking his chin. "But you also know what's just as important? Congenital traits and bloodlines. Trying to get them is such a hassle, so I'm going to be nice and let you kidnap any one child of your choosing."\nThe Dungeon Master lifts up a finger to silence your forthcoming questions, "There are stipulations, however. No rulers, no AI heirs, and no heirs of players unless they have a spare. Don't say I didn't do anything nice for you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle49;Kidnapping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt49OptA;"Only one?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMEventTooltip49Caught;the prior liege of the child is notified;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc50;"Humility is a weird concept," muses the Dungeon Master as he surveys the land. "I prefer fear when keeping people in line. Oh, and speaking of fear and humility..." The Dungeon Master grins from ear to ear and snaps his fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle50;Vassal/Liege Swap;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt50OptA;"Wha...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip50;A random independent ruler and one of their vassals will trade titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc51;\n\nEverything is eerily silent. The leaves do not rustle in the wind, the birds are quiet, even your own footsteps as you walk into the forest grove are muted.\nBefore you is a woman with pale skin and raven black hair, dressed only in a robe that matches her hair color. The scythe she wields gives you no doubt as to her identity.\n\n"Be not afraid, mortal," she speaks, nary an emotion crosses her lips, "you are fast asleep in the real world. I have come to offer you a deal." She extends a hand out, waiting for you to take it into yours. "I will grant you a longer lifespan, but in return you will die on a specific date."\n\nDeath is offering you a choice to live another 10 years as an exceptional [GetManWoman], 25 years as you are, or 50 as an inferior [GetManWoman]. But at the end of those years, Death will come back to claim you. This also does not prevent your death from the sword or the dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvt51OptD;"I refuse your deal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip51D;You wake up in bed. Was it just a dream, or was it real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc5101;You find yourself back in the familiar forest grove, lit only by the full moon. "It is time, mortal," speaks the pale reaper. "Your time on this mortal world has come to an end.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle5101;To Dream of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt5101OptA;It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc52;"People tell me I'm not kind," muses the Dungeon Master. "Well, I'll show them! BEHOLD! I shall grant a fourth of the populace the power of my dragon!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle52;Blood of the Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt52OptA;"Your dragon?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle53;Animal Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt53OptA;"What do you mean, 'whoops'?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc54NoTower;"5G!" the Dungeon Master exclaims happily. "Such a wonderful technology! It was given to me by the Lizard People, and will prooooo-" he stops to clear his throat before continuing, "...prove to be a real game changer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc54TTANoTower;"Five... gee...? What?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc54;While walking through your demense one day, you come across the damnest sight: a herd of cows- all dressed like human laborers- building a giant metal tower of some kind. You suspect it's time to take up drinking as a hobbby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"I've got a shipment of inept tea coming in, and I want you to be the first to buy in to this new craze! Here's the proof of purchase! Thanks!" He tosses the confused ape at you and steals your gold before leaving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle56;It Belongs In A Museum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc56;The Dungeon Master barges into your throneroom dressed in a leather jacket and carrying a bullwhip. "Treasures! They belong in a museum," he rants. "But don't worry. We've got top men working on it. Top men." He gives you a wide grin and places a hat on your head. "Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc56TTA;"You mean YOUR fortune and glory.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc56TTACustom;Despite the obvious risk of a copyright lawsuit, the Dungeon Master has taken it up upon himself to liberate valuable artifacts from around the world. Though, some of them may get lost in transport.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle57;For Whom The Horn Doots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc57;No man is an island, entire of itself. Each is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less. As well as if a promontory were. As well as if a manor of thine own or of thine friend's were. Each man's death diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind. Therefore, send not to know for whom the horn doots, It doots for thee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc57TTA;"Thank you, Mr Skeltal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"Listen, these are your problem now," he begins, as he opens his hand revealing six bright stones of various colours, "Fight, bribe, kill each other over them - I don't care." He begins to run out of the room, but suddenly snaps back to face you. "Just don't let HIM get them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc59;Lately, your dog has been acting strangely. It has become overly violent and refuses to drink water. Just as you were taking it out for a morning stroll, the damned thing bit you! You can see the dog foaming at the mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc59TTA;"Oh no, this can't be good!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc59NoDog;The Dungeon Master bursts into the room wearing various furs, including a canine headdress that would look more at home on a shaman. "Can I nuzzle wuzzle you? uwu you're so warm!" he says, playfully batting at you with his fake wolf paws. He suddenly sees a cat and starts chasing after it. "SNUGGLE WUGGLE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc59TTB;"What.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle60;Ruina Imperii;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc60;The Dungeon Master reads through a scroll, mumbling to himself. "Ruina Imperii? What kind of simpleton thought of something so stupid?!" A twinge of horror creeps up your spine as he looks up at you with an evil grin on his face. "It's perfect!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle2;Potion Seller;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowtitledesc2;You walk up to the man, who has just arrived in your court and proclaim that you are going into battle, and require his strongest potions.

DMCoreFollowdesc14;Having unified all seven Wyvernballs you awaken the great power contained within. A huge wyvern, taller than any tower throughout the known world, erupts from the Wyvernballs. It begins to speak:
"Greetings, I am the king of all lizards. Every single one of them. The ones on the flags, I knew them all, you know?" He continues like this for some time before realising your increasing boredom. "You're just like all the others, I thought coming to this place would finally give me someone to chat to who wasn't interested in just my power, but I see how it is. Fine.

DMCoreFollowtitle24;The Whispers in your Mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
