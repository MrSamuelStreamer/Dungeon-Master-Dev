DMCoreEvtdesc21;The Dungeon Master appears, points right at you, and laughs like a madman. Suddenly a great flash of lightning strikes the sky followed shortly by a deafening horn. Some of your soldiers drop the floor screaming, your diplomat has an instant heart attack and grandma's head explodes, painting the castle walls the colour of bingo and sherry.\n"MORTALS", a voice neighs from a great distance, or perhaps not if you're living in a realm where horses might appear suddenly, "I AM THE HORSE HORSE-LORD, ENDER OF THIS EARTH AND SCORCHER OF MAN, SCOURGE OF GLUE FACTORIES AND CHEAP FROZEN LASANGA!"

The Dungeon Master, feeling a great pity for the people in [lost_city_of_gold.GetName] decided to make all of their dreams come true and transformed the whole city, including it's foundations, and natural resources, into solid gold!\nUnfortunately, the tricky caused by the Dungeon Master had an unintended side effect - people were randomly turning to gold and infecting others with the same curse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The point is it was incredibly rude of them, I mean, all I did was this!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle29;Blessing in Disguise...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc29;"I've been doing a bit of poking around and at the bottom of a lake I found a age-old container filled to the brim with religious texts! I have no idea who put those there but, in my usually helpful nature, I've decided to forward a copy to the relevant religious heads so they can study and make the changes that their religion must have conveniently forgotten about!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt29OptA;"We have to do WHAT now?!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip29;Random religions randomly gain random alterations from a random list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle30;Realm fit for a King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc30;"Maybe I've been looking at it all wrong..." says the Dungeon Master, stroking his beard, "You sick people. You actually ENJOY this don't you? This is all game to you isn't it. Unbelievable. Well, I know exactly what will solve that problem!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt30OptA;"There's... nothing left to do...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip30;Empires are stabilised and vassals become content.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle31;Perfectly Normal Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc31;"What is WRONG with you people!?" screams the Dungeon Master, "Look at this person, this person RIGHT HERE" he says, gesturing to a perfectly normal person standing in your court. You don't recognise them but they certainly look very normal to you. "NOTHING at ALL looks strange about this person here?!" You gesture to your guards to have the Dungeon Master removed, clearly he has lost his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt31OptA;"My apologies my perfectly normal friend, welcome!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip31;A perfectly normal person joins your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle32;Fountain of Youth Uncovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc32;During routine maintenance in the temple of [fountain_of_youth_holding.GetName] in [fountain_of_youth_province.GetName] a great wellspring was discovered unlike any other - through the rockface beneath the foundation flows a seemingly unlimited source of crystal clear, glowing, water. Believing it to be a divine gift, the local ruler of the province bathed in the waters and drank deeply, only to discover that their strength grew rapidly and the ravages of time seemed to be reversed!\nThe local holy man has declared the site as sacred, with only the blessed ruler being allowed entrance into the divine fountain. Though for some jealous rulers perhaps, this may not be enough to prevent their curiosity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt32OptA;"Bountiful health and long life...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip32;The Fountain of Youth is discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip32B;The owner of the province will occasionally gain health and grow younger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle33;Gary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc33;"Let me introduce you to my friend Gary. Gary loves playing my games, don't you Gary?" asks the Dungeon Master as he slaps a timid and shellshocked man on the back, who in turn audibly squeaks. "See Gary has always dreamt big, but he never quite made it, so I'm going to let him live vicariously! Every court throughout the land will get their very own Gary, fruit directly from the loin's of Gary Prime!"\nSuddenly a nefarious looking copy of Gary pops into your court, "Buuuut..." continues the Dungeon Master, "These Gary's will be slightly amped up. Much more ambitious and skilled than the original, so watch your back!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33OptA;"Erm... welcome... Gary?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip33;Gary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle34;Friends in High Places;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc34;"I basically only exist to watch the suffering of others, but you people just do suffering so much more efficiently. There are the occasional occasions where occasionally you do take things a bit too far. Ruin the fun entirely. Here." the Dungeon Master fishes around into his pocket before handing you a small paper card - 'Get out of Jail Free' is written on it, "Just so that the suffering isn't interupted too much...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt34OptA;"This could come in handy...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip34;All rulers gain a single-use 'Get Out of Jail Free' allowing for instant release from imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle35;Prison Riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc35;"I've been doing some snooping around and noticed there were some people stuck in your basement behind bars, and try as they might they just couldn't find a way out!" You take a sharp breath and brace yourself.\n"So, I happily showed the the way out! You don't have to thank me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt35OptA;"Fetch my guards...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip35;All imprisoned characters are released and become rivals with their jailer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle36;Gavelkindness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc36;The Dungeon Master appears looking pensive "I have no idea what this Gavelkind is but everytime I bring it up you land owners always turn a funny colour." You feel your stomach turn at the sound of the forbidden word. "I've decided that a punishment for all those naughty rulers will be this 'Gavelkind' thing... whatever it is.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt36OptA;"No... he wouldn't...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip36;All characters with serious crimes such as §PImpalers§! or §RKinslayers§! will be forced into Gavelkind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle37;Spa Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc37;"I've got plans today, can't do any of the usual evil!" says the Dungeon Master, dashing through your court with a suitcase, "A Hotelier friend of mine gave me these tickets, claimed he was a huge fan of my work, but the hotel is all the way in the north west of Britainia, wherever that is. They're yours if you want them!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt37OptA;"Free Personal Trainer?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt37OptB;"Free Mud Baths?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip37A;You push yourself in a work out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip37B;You cover yourself in mud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle38;Happy Little Accident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc38;"I was visiting a friend of mine and it turns out he had someone there that definitely fit in with his... regular crowd. Anyway he's far too nice to be left down there so I'm putting him under your care. He tells me he's quite talented!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt38OptA;"Welcome Mr... Ross was it?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip38;A talented courtier arrives in your court who will produce happy little accidents while he's around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle39;Everyone's Under 4;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc39;"I just found a brilliant new game to play! It's called EU4. You take control of a kingdom somewhere in the world, and then you 'paint the map' as all my friends would say. Would you like to give it a go?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt39OptA;"I have a bad feeling about this...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip39A;playing a nice game of EU4 with the Dungeon Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip39B;playing a nice game of EU4 with the Dungeon Master, but you cant help but wonder why he's smirking...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip39C;All playable rulers are forced to play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle40;Duke Nukem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc40;"I've never understood Dukes, they're just Counts but with vassals, like Kings, or Emperors, but smaller. And don't even get me started on Petty Kings, or Dukes called Kings, or Dukes formally known as Prince? None of this makes any sense! I'm simplifying the entire system - Dukes are now banned. Emperors are next, mark my words.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt40OptA;"Nobody steals our titles... and lives!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip40;All Duke tier titles are destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle41;Stroke of Genius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc41;"It's always the same with you people" begins a very judgemental Dungeon Master, "It's always genius, strong, fair, claims, whatever with you people, never what's on the INSIDE. And that's all that counts. Well, in hindsight, I guess genius is on the inside, now that I think about it... and claims too... Well don't think you're getting away with it that easily!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt41OptA;"You seem... different?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip41;Everyone becomes Genius...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle42;Crab Rave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc42;"Look, your other options are Scorpion rave, Lion rave, or Goat rave. I think your life expectancy is much better with this, trust me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt42OptA;"I was born in September!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip42;Everyone gains Cancer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle43;Meek will Inherit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc43;"You've all had your chance and really blown it. Just absolutely ruined this earth. Temperatures are increasing, the world economy is in absolute shambles, and your kids are never going to be able to afford housing at this rate. And before you start complaing, the alternate name for this event was 'Okay Boomer' so be glad you're not going out with a bang.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt43OptA;"The nanny raised the children, not us!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip43;Rulers over 12 die a horrible death, unless players have no valid heir under 12 at which point a different fate befalls them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle44;Wyvernballs Arrive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc44;Across the known world great lights have been spotted falling from the sky. Though there are many records of rocks descending from the heavens, this time their descent is seen from every corner of the known world. Priests and holy men claim that the rocks are messages from their gods, while treasure hunters and fortune finders gear up for great expeditions to find the fallen stars.\n"I know, I know" begins the Dungeon Master "We agreed no references, but this one I've had ready for a long time and I thought I'd better put it to good use.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt44OptA;"I... I must collect more!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip44;Rulers over 12 die a horrible death, unless players have no valid heir under 12 at which point a different fate befalls them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle45;Marks and Angels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc45;"So I've been reading some of the works of some fine lads called Charles Marks and Fred Angels," the Dungeon Master says, looking up from a little red book. "Their ideas of wealth redistrubution has given me an idea...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt45OptA;"Uh oh.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt45OptB;"NO, MY PRECIOUS MONEY!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt45OptC;"Oh, this benefits me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip45;All playable rulers will have their wealth taken from them and redistributed evenly. As a side note, the Dungeon Master doesn't know what 'redistributed' means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


### Follow-up Events ###

DMCoreFollowtitle2;Potion Seller;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowtitledesc2;You walk up to the man, who has just arrived in your court and proclaim that you are going into battle, and require his strongest potions. "You don't know what you ask, traveler," he begins, "My strongest potions will kill a dragon, let alone a man. You need a seller that sells weaker potions, because my potions are too strong!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow2OptA;"No respect for anything... except your potions!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowTooltip2;You take one of the potions despite the warning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle3;Time's Up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowtitledesc2;"Well done, well done!" exclaims the Dungeon Master, "you have all outdone yourselves again!

DMCoreFollow3OptA;"That's a lot of gold...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle8;Sipping from the Fountain of Youth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowtitledesc8;You visit the Fountain of Youth at the local temple where it was uncovered. As the ruler of the province the local holy man believes you to have a divine blessing and lets you into the fountain. You drink from the fountain and feel reinvigorated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow8OptA;"I can feel the years slipping away!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle10;Empire of Gary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowtitledesc10;Empire of Gary has been formed by one ambitious Gary who rose above the rest! All Garys are rounded up and sent to the new Empire where it will stand, united in Garydom, for the rest of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow10OptA;"They... what?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowdesc12;[dead_heir.GetHerHisCap] body has been draped, by whom you do not know, in a white cloth now stained red by [dead_heir.GetHerHis] lost vitae. They say [dead_heir.GetSheHe] was found by [dead_heir.GetHerHis] horse, in a clearing in the woods. You know the place they speak of. [dead_heir.GetHerHisCap] face is calm, almost serene. You reach out to touch [dead_heir.GetHerHim]. The terrible reality of the situation dawns on you. The cold you feel is that of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow12OptA;Sorrow overtakes you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow12OptATooltip;Lose §R1§! stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow12OptB;Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle13;Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc13;At long last, you have collected all seven of the Wyvernballs. Now all that remains is to bring them together before moonlight and wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow13OptA;"I wish to conquer age and become undying!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow13OptB;"I wish to become perfect, above all else!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow13OptC;"I wish fame and gold, more than any living man!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow13OptD;"I wish for the greatest armaments the world has ever seen!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle14;Wyvern Arises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc14;Having unified all seven Wyvernballs you awaken the great power contained within. A huge wyvern, taller than any tower throughout the known world, erupts from the Wyvernballs. It begins to speak:
"Greetings, I am the king of all lizards. Every single one of them. The ones on the flags, I knew them all, you know?" He continues like this for some time before realising your increasing boredom. "You're just like all the others, I thought coming to this place would finally give me someone to chat to who wasn't interested in just my power, but I see how it is. Fine. You get one wish, then I'm gone. You hear me? GONE.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow14OptA;"Unlimited Power!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow14OptB;"I'll wait...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle15;Wyvernballs United!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc15;The Wyvernballs have been united and have left this jolly green earth to go onto a new world, unless of course the Dungeon Master decides to start the treasure hunt all over again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow15OptA;"Not again...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle16;Wyvernball Owners;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc16;The current Wyvernball owners are as follows:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow16OptA;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
